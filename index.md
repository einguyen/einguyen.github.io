### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    In lab 2, my favorite part involved part 2 since I enjoyed how the objective was to create a program that would simulate how a game of Mad Libs would play out because it showed me how a childhood game of mine could be written in code. Additionally, I learned more about using strings as a data type in order to assign characters to a specific variable. In this case, I understood more about the implementation of strings and how they should be declared, starting with including the string header file.

* Lab 6

    When working on lab 6, part 2 was my favorite because I have never truly learned how to play Blackjack, therefore reading the instructions of how the game worked allowed me to become more intrigued with developing a program to reenact the game. Thus, I liked how the lab was based on a common card game that I can now play outside of this lab. Moreover, I learned how to write ‘if’ statements that would validate command line arguments and determine whether or not the user’s input satisfies the number of arguments or the argument’s value needed for the program to produce the correct result.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 caught my attention and was a favorite because, before the lab, I had not heard of Fliegel & Van Flandern’s algorithm for calculating the number of days between two dates. By learning more about the algorithm that I would be implementing into my program, I found the equation for finding a Julian Day to be impressive and made the lab overall more interesting due to my passion for mathematics. Upon completing part 1, I learned more in-depth about converting strings to integers using the stoi() function when working with two given dates from the user’s input.
